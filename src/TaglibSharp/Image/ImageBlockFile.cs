	///    independent data blocks whose order can be changed. Metadata is
	///    stored in some of those blocks and when metadata is saved, often the

	///    overwrite some blocks with other metadata.
	///    This class extends <see cref="TagLib.Image.File" /> to provide this
	///    functionality. Blocks can be marked as metadata and when metadata is
	///    saved their space is used or they are deleted.
