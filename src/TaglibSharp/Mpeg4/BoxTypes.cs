	/// <summary>
	///    <see cref="BoxType" /> provides references to different box types

	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///    <para>This class is used to severely reduce the number of times
	///    these types are created in <see cref="AppleTag" />, greatly
	///    improving the speed at which warm files are read.</para>
	///    <para>The reason it is marked as internal is because I'm not sure
	///    I like the way the fields are named, and it is really
	///    unneccessary for external uses. While the library may use
	///    <c>DataBoxes (BoxType.Gen, BoxType.Gnre);</c>, an external user
	///    could use <c>tag.DataBoxes ("gen", "gnre");</c> with the same
	///    result.</para>
